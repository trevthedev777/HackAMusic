# KeyPlayers presents: KEYBEATS


## *"Play your keys, match the beats!"*
<br>

KeyBeats is a music memory game easy to navigate and play. The user listens to a sound sequence and then is challenged to recreate it pressing the keys in his keyboard, each one reproducing six different sounds. Success in making the sequence will bring the game to the next level: each level up will increment the sequence with one more sound!
<br>
The project has been developed to compete in the *Code Instutute Hackaton Hero Challenge*.

## Design

<br>

### Colour Palette
The colour palette is studied to highlight the keyboard buttons, whose colors are inspired by the [Launchpad X](https://novationmusic.com/it/launch/launchpad-x). These colors are metallic and allow the keyboard to pop from the background.

### Fonts

- Main font: 'Special Elite' - for the body and headings.
- Paired with: 'Yesteryear' - chosen to add a small style change for the footer.

<br>

## Features

The game is meant to be played with a keyboard and has several visual effect (shake and color of the keys, progress bar) for a better  user experience and engagement.

<br>

### Possible features to implement in future

<br>

* Add a leaderboard: 
    - Save score of every user and present it in a table.
* Play with 3 lives: 
    - Three chances to get the sequence correct, before the user loses the games and comes back to level 1.
* Introduce timing of key press for a much more engaging experience:
    - Length of keypress to determine whether user is sticking to the tempo and rhythm.
