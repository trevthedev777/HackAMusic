2. #### Keyboard musical hero type game 
   * key sounds 
   * turn based game (listen -> think -> repeat) - memory game
   * numeric keyboard / other assigned keys on the keyboard or mobile - designate sound to key press
   * sounds
     * store sample pack of sound on database / store on static files / use API (Spotify, Shazam, YouTube)
     * from instruments array of beats, array of guitar sounds etc.
